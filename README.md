🍷 Exciting Machine Learning Model Comparison on the Wine Quality Dataset! 🍷

I'm thrilled to share my latest machine-learning project, where I've explored and compared various models on a fascinating wine dataset! 📊🤖



🔍 Model Selection:

I selected a diverse set of models for this comparison⚖️ with and without hyper-parameter tuning, including:

✅Logistic Regression

✅Decision Tree

✅Random Forest

✅Bagging Classifier

✅K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

✅Support Vector Machine (SVM)

🔄 Model Training and Tuning:

To ensure optimal results, I divided the dataset into training and testing sets and conducted hyperparameter tuning for each model. 
🎯 Evaluation Metrics:

To assess the models thoroughly, I utilized an array of evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and more.
